  <p class="lead text-muted">
    This project implements <strong>Image Steganography</strong>, a technique for concealing secret
    messages or images within ordinary pictures. Using the <strong>Least Significant Bit (LSB)</strong> method,
    data can be hidden securely without noticeably altering the original image.
  </p>
  <p class="text-muted mt-3">
    The tool is built with <strong>Python (Flask)</strong> for the backend and <strong>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</strong> 
    for the frontend, making it simple, secure, and user-friendly. It allows password-protected encoding and decoding, 
    ensuring confidentiality while maintaining image quality.
  </p>
  <p class="text-muted mt-3">
    Applications of steganography include <strong>secure communication, digital watermarking, privacy protection, 
    and cybersecurity</strong>. While it strengthens data privacy, it must be used responsibly to avoid misuse.
